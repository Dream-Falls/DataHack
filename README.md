# Predicting Probabilities of XYZ and Seasonal Vaccination Uptake
## Results

The mean ROC AUC scores for each target variable and the overall score are summarized below:
   * XYZ vaccine: Mean ROC AUC score = 0.8415
   * Seasonal vaccine: Mean ROC AUC score = 0.8588
   * Overall ROC AUC score = 0.8502

The predicted probabilities for the two target variables of the 'test_set_features' dataset are stored [here](https://github.com/Dream-Falls/DataHack/blob/main/Submission_.csv).
